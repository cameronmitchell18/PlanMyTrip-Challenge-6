# PlanMyTrip-Challenge-6
Module 6 Challenge

This project was intended to get comfortable using api's. We used the OpenWeather api along with Google Maps api to get weather data and travel routes to destinations. 

The user will imput a min and max temp they would like their vacation to be and using the OpenWeather api we can show them areas on the map where that data is true.

we also used the Google Maps api to show them nearby hotels they might want to stay at and route they could take if they wanted to travel around the area.
